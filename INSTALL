1.  Clone the repo and copy src somewhere (or leave it where it is, if you're
    sure no one will 'git pull' on a running system!)

        cp -a src /some/full/path

2.  (Optional) Make a symlink for the single executable 'gitolite' to
    somewhere in `$PATH`

        ln -sf /full/path/to/some/damn/place/gitolite $HOME/bin

3.  Run setup.  That is, either run:

        gitolite setup -a YourName -pk /tmp/YourName.pub

    or, if you did not do step 2, run:

        /some/full/path/src/gitolite -a YourName -pk /tmp/YourName.pub
