# hooks and gitolite

Gitolite uses the `update` hook for all repos.  In addition, it uses the
`post-update` hook for the gitolite-admin repo.

If you want to add your own hook, it's easy as long as it's not the 'update'
hook.  Just add it to `$HOME/.gitolite/hooks/common` and run `gitolite setup`.

The rest is between you and 'man githooks' :-)
