# the "rc" file ($HOME/.gitolite.rc)

The rc file for g3 is quite different from that of g2.  It has been designed
to be (a) the only thing unique to your site, for most installations and (b)
easy to extend when new needs show up, without having to touch core gitolite.

g2 had a nasty rc file where every variable had to be declared.  As a result,
ADCs that needed their own settings could not use it.

Now it's a perl hash, and you can add any keys you want.

Please look at the rc file that gets installed when you setup gitolite.  As
you can see there are 3 types of variables in it:

  * simple variables (like UMASK)
  * lists (like `POST_COMPILE`, `POST_CREATE`)
  * hashes (like `ROLES`, `COMMANDS`)

Their purposes are to be found in each of their individual documentation files
around; start with [customising gitolite][cust].
