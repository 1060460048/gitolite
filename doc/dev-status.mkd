## #dev-status g3 development status

Not yet done (will be tackled in this order unless someone asks):

  * detailed documentation for new features
  * querying the outside world for group info (see gl-get-membership-program
    in g2)
  * mirroring
  * pulling in documentation for things that are the same in g2
  * "unrestricted arguments" for some ADCs (like git-annexe)
  * smart http
  * special features (no-create-repos, shell-access, gl-all-read-all, etc)

Help needed:

  * I'd like distro packagers to play with it and help with migration advice
    for distro-upgrades
  * [rsync][pw2], htpasswd
  * git-annexe support (but this has a pre-requisite in the previous list)

Won't be done unless someone asks (saw no evidence that anyone used them in g2
anyway!):

  * mob branches
  * password access
  * specific ADCs -- there are too many for me to bother without applying
    Pareto somewhere, so I choose to not do any and wait for people to ask :-)

Done:

  * core code
  * test suite
  * some documentation
  * distro packaging instructions
  * migration advice for common cases
