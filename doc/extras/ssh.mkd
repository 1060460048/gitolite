# ssh

There are two documents you need to read, in order:

  * [gitolite and ssh][glssh] -- this explains how gitolite uses openssh's
    features to provide any number of virtual users over just one actual
    (unix) user, and so on

  * [ssh troubleshooting][sshts] -- this is a rather long document but as far
    as I know almost every known ssh related issue is in here.  If you find
    something missing, send me an email with details.
