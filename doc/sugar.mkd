# syntactic sugar

Sugar scripts help you change the perceived syntax of the conf language.  The
base syntax of the language is as described [here][conf], so sugar scripts
take something *else* and convert it into that.

That way, the admin sees additional features (like allowing continuation
lines), while the parser in the core gitolite engine does not change.

If you want to write your own sugar scripts, please read the "your own sugar"
section in [dev-notes][] first then email me.
